Process

* Check for duplicates in ride_id column and remove if there are some. 
* Data Validation at columns:
rideable_type
member_casual
* Remove unwanted columns. Columns such as: 
ride_id
start_station_name
start_station_id
end_station_name 
end_station_id
start_lat
start_lng
end_lat
end_lng
* Split timestamps columns into new columns with the following names:
started_date
started_time
started_day
started_month
ended_date
ended_time
ended_day
ended_month

* Add a new column “ride_duration” with the duration of each ride. The ride_duration column will be the result of the subtraction of the columns:
ended_time - started_time
With the new column created we can easily spot faults of the riding time. For example we can see that there are too many ride durations under one minute. 
We will assume these as corrupted data and all the rows will be deleted. 
In the other hand, checking for the longest ride duration, which is 59m58s (202408-divvy-tripdata) we can assume that this number is totally fine.  


* Our new cleaned datasets would be contain 11 columns in the exact order:

- rideable_type
- member_casual
- ride_duration
- started_date
- started_time
- started_day
- started_month
- ended_date
- ended_time
- ended_day
- ended_month
